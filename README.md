# YuriLand - Hyprland Dotfiles
These are my Hyprland configuration files in .config/hypr/ directory. Other files are the config for software like foot, fish, rofi etc. but they will have their own GitHub repo; important thing is that my repo YuriTheme contains a software that write these just mentioned files using a palette according desktop background.  
My OS is Arch Linux and I use hyprland-git by AUR launched by UWSM (check https://wiki.hyprland.org/ for details, UWSM let things like systemd services work with Hyprland) by SDDM (cool themes for SDDM you can find [here](https://github.com/hiki-uwu/sddm-theme/tree/master)).
