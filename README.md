# YuriLand - Hyprland Dotfiles
These are my Hyprland configuration files in .config/hypr/ directory. Other files are the config for software like foot, fish, rofi etc. but they will have their own GitHub repo; important thing is that my repo YuriTheme contains a software that write these just mentioned files using a palette according desktop background.  
My OS is Arch Linux.
